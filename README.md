### Unified Reward System for Retail Vendors and Customers  

**Overview**  
- A centralized platform integrating small, medium, and large vendors to enhance customer loyalty and vendor profitability.  
- Customers earn and redeem reward points across vendors via a mobile app.  

**Key Features**  
- **Small Vendors**:  
  - Earn points after crossing spending thresholds; points are non-redeemable.  
- **Medium Vendors**:  
  - Redeemable points for discounts on future purchases.  
- **Big Vendors**:  
  - Flexible redemption policies.  
  - Big data insights for customer trends and inventory management.  

**Benefits**  
- Drives higher customer spending and repeat visits.  
- Provides actionable insights for vendors via big data analytics.  
- Boosts customer retention with personalized rewards.  

# 2) [Database Implementation:](https://github.com/AsitDesai/ECell-x-NPCI-Hackathon/tree/main/database_implementation)

### Customer Loyalty and Rewards System  

This Python script demonstrates an in-memory SQLite-based customer loyalty and rewards system, including database creation, data management, and real-time visualizations.  

## Features  
- **Database Setup**: Tables for customers, vendors, transactions, rewards, products, and analytics.  
- **Sample Data**: Pre-filled data for demonstration (5 entries per table).  
- **Visualizations**: Real-time dashboard using `matplotlib`:  
  - Transaction volumes per vendor.  
  - Reward points issued vs. redeemed.  
  - Profitability trends (revenue minus rewards).  

## Key Functions  
- Display tables using `tabulate`.  
- Analyze transactions, rewards, and profitability.  
- Generate bar and line charts for insights.

- **Impact:** Increases trust and reduces fraud.

## AI-Powered Recommendations
- **Objective:** Use AI to provide personalized product recommendations based on customer behavior.
- **Features:** Personalized suggestions, behavioral insights, and increased engagement.
- **Impact:** Boosts sales and improves customer experience.

## Multi-Currency Support
- **Objective:** Enable global support by integrating multiple currencies.
- **Features:** Currency conversion, automatic adjustments based on exchange rates.
- **Impact:** Expands the system's reach to international customers.

### Vendor Reward System Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates customer behavior in a vendor reward system across three types of vendors: Small, Medium, and Big. The goal is to simulate customer transactions before and after the implementation of a reward system, comparing sales and spending behaviors.

## Features
- **Before Reward Simulation**: Customers make random transactions with different frequencies and amounts across small, medium, and big vendors.
- **After Reward Simulation**: A reward system is introduced, where customers earn and redeem points based on their spending, which influences their behavior.
- **Threshold-Driven Spending**: Customers increase their spending when thresholds are implemented, motivated by potential rewards.
- **Increased Engagement with Fast Food and Entertainment Sectors**: The simulation reflects increased customer engagement, especially in sectors like fast food chains, with higher spending and frequency due to loyalty programs.

## Code Explanation

### `before_reward()`
Simulates transactions before rewards are implemented, calculating total sales for small, medium, and big vendors.

### `after_reward()`
Simulates transactions after rewards are implemented, incorporating loyalty points and customers' increased spending behavior due to rewards. 

### Key Simulations
- **Threshold-Driven Spending**: Customers are incentivized to increase their spending when thresholds are implemented.
- **Increased Engagement with Fast Food and Entertainment Sectors**: A boost in customer visit frequency and ticket size when loyalty programs are introduced.

### Output
- Average sales for each vendor type (Small, Medium, Big) before and after the implementation of the reward system.
- A bar chart that compares sales before and after the reward system for each vendor type.

## Running the Code
Simply run the Python script, and it will simulate the transactions, calculate average sales, and display a bar chart comparing sales before and after the reward system.
